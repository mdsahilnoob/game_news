Starlight Games, the indie studio behind the critically acclaimed puzzle platformer "Luminary," has been acquired by industry giant MegaPlay Entertainment for an undisclosed sum. The acquisition ensures continued creative freedom while providing resources for expansion.

## The Deal

MegaPlay Entertainment will provide funding and publishing support for Starlight's next three projects while allowing the original team to maintain creative control. Studio founder David Kim will continue as Creative Director.

"We were approached by several publishers, but MegaPlay's commitment to preserving our vision made them the right choice," Kim stated in a press release. "This partnership allows us to dream bigger while staying true to our roots."

## What's Next

Starlight Games is currently developing two titles:

- "Nebula Shift" - A space exploration adventure
- "Echoes in Time" - A narrative-driven mystery game

Both projects received additional funding as part of the acquisition and are expected to release within the next 18 months.

## Industry Perspective

The acquisition reflects a growing trend of major publishers investing in proven indie talent rather than competing with them. Analysts view this as a positive development for the indie game ecosystem.
