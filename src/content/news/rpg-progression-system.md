A revolutionary character progression system has been announced by indie studio Nexus Games, promising to redefine how players experience growth in role-playing games. The system, called "Adaptive Progression," dynamically adjusts skill trees and abilities based on player behavior and choices.

## Dynamic Skill Trees

Unlike traditional static skill trees, the new system evolves based on how players engage with the game world. Combat-focused players will see their skill trees branch toward martial abilities, while stealth-oriented players will unlock different paths entirely.

"We wanted to move away from pre-determined builds," explains Lead Designer Marcus Rodriguez. "The system learns from every decision you make and creates a truly unique experience for each player."

## Community Response

Early beta testers have praised the system's flexibility, noting that it eliminates the pressure of making "wrong" choices early in the game. The system has already garnered attention from major publishers interested in licensing the technology.

The full system will be integrated into Nexus Games' upcoming title, "Echoes of Eternity," scheduled for release in Q3 2025.
