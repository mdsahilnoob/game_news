TechVision has announced a major breakthrough in virtual reality technology that could eliminate one of VR gaming's most persistent problems: motion sickness. The new "SmoothMotion" system uses advanced eye-tracking combined with predictive AI to reduce latency and improve frame stability.

## How It Works

The system tracks micro-movements in the user's eyes and predicts head motion milliseconds before it occurs. By pre-rendering frames in the predicted direction, the headset eliminates the lag that typically causes discomfort.

"Traditional VR systems react to movement," explains Chief Engineer Lisa Wang. "Our system predicts movement. That split-second difference is the key to eliminating motion sickness."

## Testing Results

In clinical trials with 500 participants, 94% reported significant reduction in VR-induced discomfort. Even users who previously couldn't use VR for more than 15 minutes were able to play for extended sessions without issues.

## Availability

The technology will debut in TechVision's next-generation "Horizon Pro" headset, scheduled for release in Spring 2025 at a retail price of $599. Several major game studios have already committed to optimizing their titles for the new system.
