In a move celebrated by the gaming community, "Combat Elite" developer Phoenix Interactive has announced full cross-platform multiplayer support launching next month. The feature will unite players across PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.

## Technical Implementation

The cross-platform system includes:

- Unified matchmaking across all platforms
- Optional input-based lobbies (controller vs. keyboard/mouse)
- Shared progression and unlockables
- Cross-platform friend lists and parties

"Breaking down platform barriers has been our goal since day one," says Game Director Rebecca Foster. "Players should be able to team up with friends regardless of their hardware choice."

## Community Reception

The announcement has been overwhelmingly positive, with the game's subreddit gaining over 50,000 new subscribers in 24 hours. Many players have expressed excitement about reuniting with friends on different platforms.

## Performance Considerations

Phoenix Interactive has implemented sophisticated balancing systems to ensure fair competition between input methods. Players can opt into input-specific matchmaking if they prefer competing only against similar control schemes.

The update launches January 20, 2025, with a celebratory in-game event and exclusive cosmetic rewards for cross-platform parties.
